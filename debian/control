Description: Censorship monitoring toolkit
 cescout is a censorship monitoring toolkit that queries multiple internet
 measurement projects to identify censorship events and internet outages. It
 serves as an interface to collect data from different projects to identify
 such events in a given country and uses that information to generate a report
 that helps distinguish between censorship of particular websites from broader
 internet outages or shutdowns.
 .
 cescout does not perform any internet measurements by itself.
